# Internals

At a very high level, **fuel.nix** does the following:

1. [**Generate unique "manifests" for each version of each package**](./internals/generating-manifests.html)
   every night at 00:00 UTC under the `./manifests` directory using a CI action
   that runs the `./scripts/refresh-manifests.sh` script.
2. [**Provide `package` flake outputs**](./internals/providing-packages.html)
   (e.g. `forc-0-20-0`, `fuel-core-0-18-0-nightly-2023-04-29`) by collecting,
   filtering (`filters.nix`) and patching (`patches.nix`) all manifests. Also
   provide package **sets** for the latest semver releases and nightlies e.g.
   (`fuel-latest`, `fuel-nightly`).
3. [**Provide a special set of "milestone" packages**](./internals/providing-milestones.html)
   (e.g. `forc-wallet-beta-2`) and package sets (e.g. `fuel-beta-3`) by finding
   packages that match the commits specified in `milestones.nix`.
4. **Provide `devShell`s** to assist working on the fuel repos by collecting all
   of the inputs to their associated packages and inheriting their environment
   variables.
