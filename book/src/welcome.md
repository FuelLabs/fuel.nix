# Welcome

**fuel.nix** provides an easy, reliable way of using Fuel tools.

Each night at midnight (UTC) [**the fuel.nix repo**](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel.nix) is automatically
updated with the latest stable and nightly releases of all fuel packages. Builds
are tested and cached for both **Linux** and **macOS** systems.

Check out the [**Quick Start**](./quick-start.html) to dive in!
