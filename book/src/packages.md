## Running Packages

You can run any of the above programs without installing them like so:

```
nix run github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#fuel-core
```

To run the latest nightly for a package, add `-nightly` to the end, e.g.

```
nix run github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#forc-nightly
```

Similarly, run the version of a package from a milestone with `-<milestone>`, e.g.

```
nix run github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#forc-lsp-beta-3
```
```
nix run github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#forc-wallet-beta-1
```

## Temporary Shells

To enter a temporary shell with all of the fuel packages available on `$PATH`,
you can use the following:

```
nix shell github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#fuel
```

When you `exit` the shell the tools will no longer be on the `PATH`.

The `nix shell` command is useful for maintaining isolated, temporary
environments and to avoid endlessly polluting your `PATH` with different
versions. E.g. in the following, we trivially switch between a stable fuel
toolchain and nightly toolchain:

```sh
$ nix shell github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#fuel

# All latest stable `fuel` packages on `PATH`.

$ exit

# No fuel packages on `PATH`

$ nix shell github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#fuel-nightly

# All latest nightly `fuel` packages on `PATH`.

$ exit

# No fuel packages on `PATH`

$ nix shell github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#fuel-beta-3

# All beta-3 milestone `fuel` packages on `PATH`.
```

## Installing Packages

To install fuel packages persistently for the current user:

```console
nix profile install github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#fuel
```

To view whats installed for the current user:

```console
nix profile list
```

To upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions:

```console
nix profile upgrade
```

You can optionally specify a specific package to upgrade.

To remove an installed package:

```console
nix profile remove 3
```

where `3` is the index of the package when running `nix profile list`.

For more options around managing nix user profiles, see [the
docs](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-profile.html).

> **NOTE:** If a previous version of Nix was installed on the system, the
> `nix profile` command may not work due to an old symlink being present in $HOME.
> See [**this issue**](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer/issues/477).
> If you encounter this issue, you can remedy it by deleting the `~/.nix-profile`
> symlink so that the `nix profile` commands can recreate it with the correct
> path.


## Specifying Versions

To specify a specific version, append the semver or nightly date to the end:

```
nix run github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#forc-fmt-0-24-1
```
```
nix run github:fuellabs/fuel.nix#forc-fmt-0-24-3-nightly-2022-09-14
```

> **Note:** that when building an older version or nightly, they may no longer
> be available in the binary cache and may need to be rebuilt!
