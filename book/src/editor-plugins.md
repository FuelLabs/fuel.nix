# Editor Plugins

Currently this flake and [its overlay](./overlays.html) only provide the
`sway-vim` Vim plugin.

Contributions adding support for other editors/IDE plugins are more than
welcome!

In the meantime, you can [install the Sway VS Code plugin from the
marketplace][vscode-sway-plugin] as per usual.
